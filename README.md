# GUI Application Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. 
The notebook demonstrates how to build and run a GUI using Python, likely with a framework such as `tkinter`.

## Features

- **GUI Development**: Code to create user-friendly graphical interfaces.
- **Custom Functions**: Includes functions for handling user input, events, and application logic.
- **Interactive Execution**: The notebook allows for testing and modifying the GUI interactively.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and the GUI application, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python in most distributions)
  - Any additional dependencies mentioned in the notebook

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the notebook file:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies if necessary.

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GUI.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to create and launch the GUI application.

## Customization

- Modify the GUI layout or components by editing the relevant code cells.
- Add more features or event handlers to extend the application's functionality.

## Notes

- Ensure your Python environment supports GUI libraries like `tkinter`.
- For advanced GUI needs, consider migrating the code to standalone scripts or using frameworks like PyQt or Kivy.
